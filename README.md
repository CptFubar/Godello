# Godello (aka GodoTrello) ![Godot 3.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-v3.4-blue) 

As with the original project [Godello](https://github.com/alfredbaudisch/Godello), this branch of the 
project implements a kanban board software but with the limited feature set of a single local user.
The goal of this branch was to offer a way to store the data locally in addition to the solution based on Elixir.\
(follow the main branch for a detailed description, see link above)

## Project Plans

For now the project is basic and functional but additional features are planed in order to have a more complete featureset.
